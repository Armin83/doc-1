An example plugin... This is designed to show you various possibilities that are offered to plugins from GLPi core.

As this plugin does nothing in reality, there is no documentation for it. You would like to refer to :doc:`plugins presentation <../presentation>`, `plugins developer manual <http://glpi-developer-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/master/plugins.html>`_ or even :doc:`empty plugin <../empty/index>` to get started.
